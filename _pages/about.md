I graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) with a Master of Science in Robotics (Thesis; MSR) degree, having completed my undergrad at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). My masterâ€™s thesis, conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Manuela Veloso](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/) and [Dr. Stephanie Rosenthal](https://www.rosenthalphd.com/), focused on Explainable AI applied to Vision and Robotics. Prior to my current role at [Tempus AI Inc.](https://www.tempus.com/), I worked at [Abridge AI](https://abridge.com/), where I spearheaded the development of conversation understanding capabilities for various healthcare actors, and led ML R&D for automatic doctor documentation.

My professional experience spans across both startup environments, where I built breakthrough ML products from scratch and scaling the company from 0 to 200 Million $, as well as large product and research-oriented companies. Additionally, I am a member of the International Consortium for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and (Shared Decision Making (SDM) special interest groups)[https://www.isdmsociety.org/special-interest-groups-icai/].

Academically, my interests lie in Health AI, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Understanding, and Machine Learning. Currently, at Tempus, I am delving into new avenues for Generative AI in Healthcare. Notable recent research includes fine-tuning LLMs, enhancing Summarization Models with Human Feedback and Edits, and devising new metrics for evaluating LLM-generated summaries and Speaker Diarization. My work has been published across top-tier conferences in fields such as LLMs, NLP, Speech, Computer Vision, Robotics, and Reinforcement Learning.

Throughout my career, I have worked extensively with popular Deep Learning frameworks, large datasets, Cloud platforms, and MLOps tools like Kubernetes and Pub/Sub.

<!-- My main academic interests are in Reinforcement Learning, Natural language Understanding, and Machine Learning. In addition, I have worked on Explainable AI, Computer Vision, and Planning. I just joined Tempus to explore new avenues for Generative AI in Healthcare. At Abridge, I developed a first-of-its-kind conversation understanding capabilities for various healthcare actors. I created and led ML R&D for Abridge's automatic doctor documentation product. The product generates accurate clinical notes using clinical conversations with generative AI.

I have publications across areas like LLMs, NLP, Speech, Computer Vision, Robotics, and Reinforcement Learning at top-tier conferences. Some of my recent interesting research works includes improving summarization models with human-edit information and developing custom metrics to evaluate LLM summaries. I have worked with popular Deep Learning frameworks, large data sets, Cloud platforms, and MLOps tools like Kubernetes, and Pub/Sub.

Recent work: Fine-tunning LLMs, improving Summarization Models with Human Feedback and Edits, developing new metrics to evaluate LLM-generated summaries and Speaker Diarization -->
